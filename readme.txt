Light-weight plugin that converts your Woocommerce variations in to radio buttons.

== Description ==
This is a compatible version of Woo Radio Buttons for Woocommerce 2.0 and above.  For earlier versions please visit designloud.com.  This is a simple and light-weight plugin that once installed and activated will convert your Woocommerce variations from a drop down menu to radio buttons.

1. Upload `woo-radio-buttons-3.0` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. (Optional) Make sure you are using variations for your product(s) and set a default variation to be selected in your edit product page to automatically display the add to cart button.

== Frequently asked questions ==
= How to display 'add to cart' and selected variation automatically =
Open your WP Dashboard and click on products, then click on one of your variation products and scroll down to product data.  Under the tab 'variations' select a default variation (towards the bottom) and click update :).

= I just updated your plugin and my radio buttons do not work anymore =
Make sure that you have updated to the latest version of Woocommerce and mapped your product data as their notification suggests.

= I have downloaded your plugin and activated but I still do not get any radio buttons =
This is typically caused by a theme or plugin conflicting.  Try activating the default twenty-twelve wordpress theme.  If that doesnt work then go through and deactivate your plugins and then reactivate one at a time to find the conflict.
